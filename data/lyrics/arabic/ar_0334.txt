Okay, I sing in English
Okay, I can speak French
And maybe if you see me
You could think I'm from Paris
There's been a hurricane
There's been a hurricane
People don't know where they come from
So how could they know where they go
This is a folk guitar
This is a folk guitar
But there's ain't no European groove that roll behind me
Egleb than eloui
Call it African folk
Call it gnawa blues
It is just rock and roll
Sang by a Moroccan soul
Call chaabi funk
Call it ayta jazz
It is just haiha music
Coming from deep of our soul
Don't call it world music
No no no no no world music
I don't know how to call it
It's just the music of my world
Of course!
Call it African folk
Call it gnawa blues
It is just haiha music
Coming from deep of our soul
Call chaabi funk
Call it ayta jazz
It is just haiha music
Coming from deep of our soul
Haiha music
