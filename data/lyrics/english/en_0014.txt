I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you
(About you),

And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true,
I'm a sucker for you
Yeah
Don't complicate it (Yeah)

I can't remember (Yeah) all of the nights
I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas,
Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas

I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious
[Chorus: Nick Jonas &
Joe Jonas
]
I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you
(About you),
about you
(About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true,
I'm a sucker for you
Yeah (Uh)
