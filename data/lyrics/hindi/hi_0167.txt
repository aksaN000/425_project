Time
She's a hateful being
Hear menacing rings
Don't count on her babe
The clock always swings
I'll remind you
That the end is near
She's always so near
Won't know when she comes
Won't tell you she's here
So I, take my two steps back
Count the blessings that I have
I got no regrets
Still giving what I get
Hold on to here
Hold on to here
Love
It’s the only truth
You win or you lose
Don’t wish on a star
The sun or the moon
'Cause I'll remind you
That the end is near
She's always so near
Won't know when she comes
Won't tell you she's here
So I, take my two steps back
Count the blessings that I have
I got no regrets
Still giving what I get
Hold on to here
Hold on to here
I take my two steps back
Count the blessing that I have
I got no regrets
Still giving what I get
