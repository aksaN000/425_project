Alone A single by Alan Walker featuring vocals by Noonie Bao. This song reminds listeners that they are never truly alone, regardless of where they are physically. Lost in your mind I wanna know Am I losing my mind? Never let me go If this night is not forever At least we are together I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone Anywhere, whenever Apart, but still together I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone Unconscious mind I'm wide awake Wanna feel one last time Take my pain away If this night is not forever At least we are together I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone Anywhere, whenever Apart, but still together I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone I know I'm not alone I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone I know I'm not alone I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone I know I'm not alone
