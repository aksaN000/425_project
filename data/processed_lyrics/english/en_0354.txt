All in all, it was just a brick in the wall All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall Hey ! *Children playing* We don't need no education We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teacher, leave them kids alone Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone! All in all, it's just another brick in the wall All in all, you're just another brick in the wall We don't need no education Wе don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teachers, lеave them kids alone Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone! All in all, you're just another brick in the wall All in all, you're just another brick in the wall Wrong, do it again! (*Children playing*) Wrong, do it again! If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! (Wrong, do it again!) How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat? (Wrong, do it again!) You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie! (If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?) (You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!) *Children playing* *Phone beeping sound* *televisions being smashed* I don't need no arms around me And I don't need no drugs to calm me I have seen the writing on the wall Don't think I need anything at all No, don't think I'll need anything at all All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall
