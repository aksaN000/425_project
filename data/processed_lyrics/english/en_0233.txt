Cole ] You lost in the shape of my hips Hope there is a move If you really down, we could find it Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy ( Oh, oh, oh, oh ) Hope there is a move ( Oh, oh, oh, oh ) And if you really down, we could find it Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can [Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole ] Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets ( Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ) You crossed my mind a thousand times The cause was fine, I drawed the line I'm back, relapse, I'm fiending Yes, what's that? In fact, I'm dreaming Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets I got a shot at you, you wanna reach? Cock that, cock back, trigger release Pop that top, take a sip of your holiest water, I know I'm a part of your flow now Said, when you cut her, don't matter you love her or not, you got part of her soul now I ain't know then, but I know now Apologies due, it wasn't a feud, the ones I ran through, but never left you, I pray you found peace and you whole now I'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar, climbin' on top of the bar Think of the shea butter, lick in the places you only gon' lick when you rock with her forever [Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole ] You lost in the shape of my hips Hope there is a move And if you really down, we could find it Lost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy ( Oh, oh, oh, oh ) Hope there is a move ( Oh, oh, oh, oh ) And if you really down, we could find it Lost in an alley, make love [Chorus: Ari Lennox & J. Cole ] Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow (I can get close to you, baby, pull me closer, what are you about?) Shea butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets ( Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ) (I can get close to you, baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)
