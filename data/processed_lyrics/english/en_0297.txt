Layla What will you do when you get lonely? No one waiting by your side You've been running, hiding much too long You know it's just your foolish pride Layla, you got me on my knees Layla, begging, darling, please Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind? I tried to give you consolation When your old man let you down Like a fool I fell in love with you You turned my whole world upside down Layla, you got me on my knees Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind? Make the best of the situation Before I finally go insane Please don't say we'll never find a way Or tell me all my love's in vain Layla, you got me on my knees Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind? Layla, you got me on my knees Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
