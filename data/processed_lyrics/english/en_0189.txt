Puppet Theatre Ringing out the old and shining in the new We've been bought and sold and don't know what to do All these empty lies, we bastardise the truth We're left in the cold and now it's up to you You've been tricked and you made up your mind Without even thinking All the good deeds you did left behind And the options are shrinking Do you know why we all look the same? The scale of destruction You feel guilty and know who to blame It's the Puppet Theatre The Puppet Theatre Half the population lying on the couch And the rest of us in a constant state of doubt Yeah they look so neat - snazzed up in shirt and tie But you wouldn't want to peek at the rot in the side You've been tricked and you made up your mind Without even thinking All the good deeds you did left behind And the options are shrinking Do you know why we all look the same? The scale of destruction You feel guilty and know who to blame It's the Puppet Theatre The Puppet Theatre Living in a box, no windows to the world Not caught up your sleeve no hate to watch you hurt Let me be your guide to fall off from your cliff Laying side by side till we're cold and stiff Till we're cold and stiff
