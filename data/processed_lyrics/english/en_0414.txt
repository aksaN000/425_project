(D-D-Dark side) We're not in love Just somethin' in your eyes Don't be afraid The shadows know me Let's leave the world behind Take me through the night Fall into the dark side We don't need the light We'll live on the dark side I see it, let's feel it While we're still young and fearless Let go of the light Fall into the dark side Fall into the dark side Give in to the dark side Let go of the light Fall into the dark side Beneath the sky As black as diamonds We're runnin' out of time (Time, time) Don't wait for truth To come and blind us Let's just believe their lies Believe it, I see it I know that you can feel it No secrets worth keepin' So fool me like I'm dreamin' Take me through the night Fall into the dark side We don't need the light We'll live on the dark side I see it, let's feel it While we're still young and fearless Let go of the light Fall into the dark side Fall into the dark side Give in to the dark side Let go of the light Fall into the dark side (D-D-Dark side) (Dark side) (Dark side) (Dark side) Take me through the night Fall into the dark side We don't need the light We'll live on the dark side I see it, let's feel it While we're still young and fearless Let go of the light Fall into the dark side
