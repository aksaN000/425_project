It was released on 2007. Sloe Gin, sloe Gin Tryin’ to wash away the pain inside Well I’m sick and I’m all done in And I’m standing in the rain And I feel like I’m gonna cry I’m so damn lonely And I ain’t even high I’m so damn lonely And I feel like I’m gonna die Mayday, mayday I’ve been shot down Over the stormy sea Well I feel that I’m drifting away Can not seem to get a grip on me Well. I can’t even try I’m so damn lonely Ain’t even high I hate to go home alone But what else is new? I’m so damn lonely I hate to go home alone But what else is new? I’m so damn lonely… You stand and bleeding people pass me by No matter if you live No matter if you die Sloe Gin, sloe Gin Tryin’ to wash away the pain inside Well I’m sick and I’m all done in I’m standing in the rain And I feel like I’m gonna die I’m so damn lonely Ain’t even high I’m so damn lonely… *Police Sirens* Sloe gin Ohohoh Hey, they're gonna get the best of me, yeah
