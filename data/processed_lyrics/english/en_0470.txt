Back for Good I guess now it's time For me to give up, I feel it's time Got a picture of you beside me Got your lipstick marks still on your coffee cup, oh yeah Got a fist of pure emotion, got a head of shattered dreams I've got to leave it, I've got to leave it all behind now Whatever I said Whatever I did, I didn't mean it I just want you back for good (Want you back, I want you back, I want you back for good) Whenever I'm wrong Just tell me the song and I'll sing it You'll be right and understood (Want you back, want you back) I want you back for good (I want you back for good) Unaware, but underlined I figured out this story (No, no) It wasn't good (No, no) But in a corner of my mind (Corner of my mind) I celebrated glory But that was not to be In the twist of separation You excelled at being free Can't you find (Can't you find?) A little room inside for me? Whatever I said (Whenever I'm wrong) Whatever I did, I didn't mean it (I'll tell you) I just want you back for good (Want you back, want you back) See, I want you back for good (Want you back for good) Whenever I'm wrong (Whenever I'm wrong) Just tell me the song and I'll sing it (I'll tell you) You'll be right and understood (Want you back, I want you back) I want you back for good (Want you back for good) And we'll be together This time is forever (Forever, now) We'll be fighting and forever we will be So complete in our love We will never be uncovered again Whatever I said (Whenever I'm wrong) Whatever I did, I didn't mean it (I'll tell you) I just want you back for good (Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) Whenever I'm wrong (Whenever I'm wrong) Just tell me the song and I'll sing it (I'll tell you) You'll be right and understood (Want you back, want you back) See, I want you back for good (Want you back for good) (Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it) Whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you (I just want you back for good) (I want you back) Want you back (I want you back) I want you back for good (Want you back for good) (Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it) Whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you (You'll be right and understood) I want you back (Want you back), I want you back (Want you back) You see, I want you back for good (Want you back for good) Oh, yeah I guess now it's time that you came back for good
