Unsupervised Learning Project: VAE for Hybrid
Language Music Clustering
Course: Neural Networks
Prepared By: Moin Mostakim
Submission Due: January 10th,2026
Project Overview
In this project, you will implement an unsupervised learning pipeline inspired by Varia
tional Autoencoders (VAE) for clustering hybrid language music tracks. The goal is to
extract latent representations from audio and/or lyrics and perform clustering. You will
explore different VAE architectures, analyze clustering results, and compare with baseline
methods (e.g., K-Means, PCA).
Deliverables:
1. GitHub Repository: Code implementation, dataset processing scripts, and results.
2. NeurIPS-like Paper Report: PDF report in a scientific format describing method,
experiments, results, and discussion.
Project Tasks
Easy Task
• Implement a basic VAE for feature extraction from music data.
• Use a small hybrid language music dataset (English + Bangla songs).
• Perform clustering using K-Means on latent features.
• Visualize clusters using t-SNE or UMAP.
• Compare with baseline (PCA + K-Means) using Silhouette Score and Calinski
Harabasz Index.
Medium Task
• Enhance VAE with convolutional architecture for spectrograms or MFCC features.
• Include hybrid feature representation: audio + lyrics embeddings.
• Experiment with clustering algorithms: K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, DB
SCAN.
1
• Evaluate clustering quality using metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index,
Adjusted Rand Index (if partial labels are available).
• Compare results across methods and analyze why VAE representations perform
better/worse than baselines.
Hard Task
• Implement Conditional VAE (CVAE) or Beta-VAE for disentangled latent repre
sentations.
• Perform multi-modal clustering combining audio, lyrics, and genre information.
• Quantitatively evaluate using metrics: Silhouette Score, Normalized Mutual Infor
mation (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Cluster Purity.
• Provide detailed visualizations: latent space plots, cluster distribution over lan
guages/genres, reconstruction examples from VAE latent space.
• Compare VAE-based clustering with PCA + K-Means, Autoencoder + K-Means,
and direct spectral feature clustering.
Sample Datasets
• Million Song Dataset (MSD): http://millionsongdataset.com/ Large-scale
dataset with audio features, metadata, and lyrics (partial). Useful for clustering
music by audio features and genres.
• GTZANGenreCollection: http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html
1000 audio tracks categorized by 10 genres. Can extract MFCC/spectrogram fea
tures for VAE input.
• JamendoDataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/jamendo-music-dataset
Songs with audio previews, metadata, and lyrics. Great for hybrid (audio + lyrics)
embedding experiments.
• MIR-1KDataset: https://sites.google.com/site/unvoicedsoundseparation/
mir-1k 1000 song clips in Mandarin and English. Useful for multi-language exper
iments.
• LakhMIDIDataset(LMD):https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/MIDI
dataset for music modeling. Can be converted to audio features and combined with
lyrics from other sources.
• Kaggle Lyrics Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=lyrics
Multiple datasets containing song lyrics in English, Hindi, Bangla, and other lan
guages. Can combine with audio features for hybrid VAE experiments.

Metrics and Mathematical Formulations
For each clustering metric, we provide a description and the mathematical formula to
help you understand and compute them clearly.
1. Silhouette Score (S)
Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
s(i) = b(i)−a(i)
max(a(i),b(i))
where:
• a(i) = average distance between i and all other points in the same cluster.
• b(i) = minimum average distance between i and all points in other clusters.
The score ranges from-1 to 1. Higher is better.
2. Calinski-Harabasz Index (CH)
Measures ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance.
CH= tr(Bk)/(k −1)
tr(Wk)/(n − k)
where:
• k =number of clusters
3
• n =number of points
• Bk = between-cluster dispersion matrix
• Wk =within-cluster dispersion matrix
Higher values indicate better clustering.
3. Davies-Bouldin Index (DB)
Average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster.
DB= 1
k 
k
i=1 
max
j̸=i
where:
σi +σj
dij
• σi = average distance of points in cluster i to its centroid
• dij = distance between centroids of clusters i and j
Lower DB indicates better clustering.
4. Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
Measures similarity between predicted clusters and ground truth labels.
ARI = RI−Expected RI
max(RI) −Expected RI
where RI (Rand Index) measures the fraction of pairs correctly clustered. ARI is
adjusted for chance. Higher is better (1 = perfect match, 0 = random labeling).
5. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
Measures mutual information between predicted clusters and true labels, normalized to
[0,1].
NMI(U,V) = 2I(U;V)
H(U)+H(V)
where:
• I(U;V) = mutual information between clustering U and labels V
• H(U),H(V) = entropies of clusters and labels
Higher values indicate better agreement with labels.
4
6. Cluster Purity
Fraction of the dominant class in each cluster.
Purity = 1
n k 
max
j
where:
• ck = set of points in cluster k
• tj = set of points in true class j
• n =total number of points
|ck ∩ tj|
Higher purity indicates better clustering with respect to ground truth.
